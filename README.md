# Dijkstra and A* algortihms

This project is developed for the course of [Data structures and algorithms of physics of data][1], held by C. Mereghetti and D. Tamascelli at the University of Milan, a. y. 2020-2021.

Its purpose is to implementt two simple, yet powerful, algorithms for the _single source shortest path_ problem on a graph. These algortihms are [Dijkstra's][3] and [A*][2].  
The code will be written in [Kotlin][4].
